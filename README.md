## Hi! I’m Bruno 👋

I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys building practical systems from scratch, automating workflows, and turning data into clear, actionable insights.

I’m especially interested in environments without a predefined playbook — learning fast, experimenting with new tools, and shipping solutions that actually get used.

## What I Do 🚀

- Build internal tools and systems focused on efficiency and scalability  
- Automate workflows using code, integrations, and APIs  
- Work with data to support decision-making and business insights  
- Translate technical concepts into simple, clear explanations
